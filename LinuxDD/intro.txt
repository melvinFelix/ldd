kernel is the core of the operating system

Linux kernel is written in assembly and c

assembly is hardware dependent
c is mostly hardware independent

there are two spaces namely 
1.kernel space
2.user space

kernel space mostly consists of hardware applications 
and user space mostly software

Linux is capable of several processes

kernel handles important things in OS like memory management,power management and process management

##  every process has a process id

## Linux supports round robin

Linux commands:
